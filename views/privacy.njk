                    of reasons: to tell you about stuff you’ve asked us to tell you about; to contact you if we need to obtain
                    or provide additional information; to check our records are right and to allow you to use Play Gym.

                    'OK' to continue using the product, otherwise, you will not be able to access Play Gym.
